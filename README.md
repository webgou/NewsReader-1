NewsReader
==========

NewsReader is a native iOS Universal app for reading news from JSON APIs. It's currently coded to support APIs from the Huffington Post, but it would be relatively easy to add support for a wide variety of content sources that offer JSON APIs.

Dependencies
------------
Xcode Version 4.4.1 (4F1003)
RestKit (https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit)
Huffington Post APIs v1


Description (iPhone)
-----------
The home screen is mapped to the Huffington Post Top News feed, by default. The section name will be displayed along the top of the screen. Flipping left/right will page through the stories in the feed. The stories will be displayed with their image, title, tag line, author, date published, and abstract.

Flipping up/down will page through the current story.

Clicking on the section name will display a menu containing the list of sections. Selecting a different section will change the feed to the feed for that section.

Entering search terms in the search bar will produce a feed containing the resulting stories.
